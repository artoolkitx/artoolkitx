    @abstract   C-interface to OpenSceneGraph for augmented reality applications.
    @discussion
        arosg is intended to provide access to the modern plugin-based scene graph   
        OpenSceneGraph, and its attendant model formats and graphical capabilities.
 
        arosg provides a C-based interface to a limited subset of the
        functionality of OpenSceneGraph. As of version 1.0 of arosg, the
        supported functionality is primarily 3D model loading and drawing.
    @availability Available ARToolKit v4.4.2 and later.

    @function
    @abstract   Get the version of ARToolKit with which the arOSG library was built.
    @discussion
        It is highly recommended that
        any calling program that depends on features in a certain
        ARToolKit version, check at runtime that it is linked to a version
        of ARToolKit that can supply those features. It is NOT sufficient
        to check the ARToolKit SDK header versions, since with ARToolKit implemented
        in dynamically-loaded libraries, there is no guarantee that the
        version of ARToolKit installed on the machine at run-time will be as
        recent as the version of the ARToolKit SDK which the host
        program was compiled against.
    @result
        Returns the full version number of the ARToolKit version corresponding
        to this OSG library, in binary coded decimal (BCD) format.

        BCD format allows simple tests of version number in the caller
        e.g. if ((arGetVersion() >> 16) > 0x0272) printf("This release is later than 2.72\n");

        The major version number is encoded in the most-significant byte
        (bits 31-24), the minor version number in the second-most-significant
        byte (bits 23-16), the tiny version number in the third-most-significant
        byte (bits 15-8), and the build version number in the least-significant
        byte (bits 7-0).

        The format of this file is a simple text file. Comments may be
        included by prefixing the line with a "#" character.
        The object definition consists of the following:
        <ul>
        <li> A line with the path to the object's data file, relative to the
            objects file. (This path may include spaces.)
        <li> A line with the position of the object's origin, relative to the
            parent coordinate system's origin, expressed as 3 floating point
            numbers separated by spaces, representing the offset in x, y, and z.
            This is the same format used by the glTranslate() function.
        <li> A line with the orientation of the object's coordinate system,
            relative to the parent coordinate system, expressed as 4 floating
            point numbers separated by spaces, representing an angle and an
            axis of a rotation from the parent. This is the same format used
            by the glRotate() function.
        <li> A line with the scale factor to apply to the object, expressed
            as 3 floating point numbers separated by spaces, representing the
            scale factor to apply in x, y, and z.
            This is the same format used by the glScale() function.
        <li> Zero or more lines with optional tokens representing additional
            information about the object. The following tokens are defined:
            <ul>
            <li> LIGHTING f: Enables or disables lighting calculations for this
                object. Note that disabling lighting will result in the
                object being drawn fully lit but without shading.
                f = 0 to disable, f = 1 to enable. Default is enabled.
            <li> TRANSPARENT: Provides a hint that this object includes transparent
                portions, and should be drawn alpha-blended. Default is
                that no transparency hint is provided.
            <li> TEXTURES: Provides a hint that this object includes textured
                portions, and should be drawn with texturing enabled. Default is
                that no texturing hint is provided.
            <li> SELECTABLE f: Enables or disables the ability for this model to
                be selectable by hit-testing methods.
                f = 0 to disable, f = 1 to enable. Default is enabled.
